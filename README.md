# Memory Game

A simple memory matching game built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS. The goal of the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards by flipping them two at a time.

## Features

- **Flip Animation**: Smooth card flipping animation using CSS.
- **Matching Logic**: Check if two cards match. If they do, they remain flipped; if not, they flip back after a brief delay.
- **Shuffle Functionality**: The cards are shuffled into a random order every time the game starts.
- **Board Locking**: The game prevents users from flipping more than two cards at a time, ensuring correct gameplay.
